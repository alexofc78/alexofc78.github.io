Last year, I decided to start this journey at the end of summer. I´m a 41-year-old product designer, Corporate Image Advisor for the last 13 years, owner of a bakery business, wife to a wonderful husband and mother of three +one (my 4 legged son)

The world of coding is completely unknown to me, and that bothers me. I´m handy at many many things. When I have to do something, I just say ok, and figure it out. When I started, totally lost, I did manage to organize my schedule and follow a plan. I did it, for about 8 weeks I was almost 2 ahead of time, unfortunately cometimes fate plays games on you and turns things upside down.

Lost my pace, got behing in llessons, labs, couldnt make it. A very bad situation at work absorbed 120% of my time... Yeap, it happens! 6 months later, another chance, another start. Hopefully I won´t be as rusty! I´ll make it this time!!

Nowadays even more we see the essential role technology plays in our daily life. I need to understand it, to deal with it and work with it. Coding is about creating, designing so I´m into it.

*Let´s see how I do!*
